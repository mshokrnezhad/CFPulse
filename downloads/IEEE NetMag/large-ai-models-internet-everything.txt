The Internet of Everything (IoE) integrates data from various sources—things, humans, and processes—into a unified system. This data-driven framework relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods as key enablers for the advancement of IoE. However, IoE applications present unique challenges that extend beyond those faced by traditional AI models. These challenges include the management of highly dynamic, heterogeneous data streams, the need for diversified decision making, and addressing the scalability issues of distributed systems.

Large AI Models (LAMs), including large language models (e.g., ChatGPT and LLaMA), large vision models (e.g., SAM and DINO), and large multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4 and Gemini Pro), represent the cutting edge of generative AI. LAMs have the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional AI in IoE applications by supporting cognitive-level intelligent decision-making, heterogeneous data analysis and processing, personalized user-centered services, and adaptive learning and optimization, all based on the massive, dynamic data streams inherent in IoE systems. However, the integration of LAMs into the IoE ecosystem presents several critical challenges, which include the need for efficient resource scheduling, optimization of learning processes, model compression for resource-constrained environments, and the acceleration of inference tasks to support real-time decision-making.

This Special Issue (SI) aims to engage researchers from both academia and industry to explore the in-depth integration of LAMs with the IoE, focusing on how LAMs can meet the requirements of the IoE, and how the IoE can further enhance the capabilities of LAMs. Consequently, the topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

* LAMs for intelligent data compression and transmission technologies in IoE.
* LAMs for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system in IoE.
* LAMs for edge digital twin and metaverse applications in IoE.
* LAMs for network security and privacy concerns in IoE.
* LAMs for intelligent network topology optimization in IoE.
* LAMs for networking performance optimization in IoE.
* LAMs for Non-Terrestrial-Network (NTN) in IoE.
* LAMs for task-oriented semantic communication in IoE.
* LAMs for resource scheduling algorithm design in IoE.
* Low-complexity algorithm design for LAMs in IoE.
* Self-learning and transfer learning mechanisms of LAMs in IoE.
* Lightweight LAMs for IoE services and applications.
* LAM-driven anomaly/intrusion detection for IoE.
