This page aims to outline a comprehensive guideline for selecting a promising research subject. The document comprises five sections: directions, use cases, objectives, constraints, and approaches. Directions discuss possible research trends for systems that go beyond the capabilities of 5G. Each direction is meticulously outlined by 1) highlighting potential use cases or 2) addressing challenging problems within it by specifying clear objectives and constraints relevant to the subject matter. Subsequently, all conceivable use cases introducing promising futuristic services, objectives delineating potential goals for addressing associated problems and subproblems, and constraints identifying limitations requiring consideration in problem-solving, are elaborated upon.

Irrespective of the specified directions, any combination <u, o, c> where u ∈ use cases, o ∈ objectives, and c ∈ constraints defines a research endeavor that can be addressed using the methods described in approaches by researchers (postdocs, Ph.D. candidates, or master's students, depending on the complexity of the combination) to yield scientific outcomes. It is indisputable that advanced scenarios can be generated by merging directions, and complex problems can be developed by taking into account joint objectives and multiple constraints.

### Serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

- Serverless computing, also known as FaaS, is a cloud computing model where cloud providers manage the infrastructure needed to run code, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying functions without worrying about server management. In serverless computing, developers upload their code as functions to the cloud provider’s platform, and the platform automatically handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of the underlying infrastructure required to execute those functions.
- A simple example of serverless computing is a web application that needs to resize images uploaded by users. Instead of setting up and managing a server to constantly monitor and process image uploads, a developer can create a function that listens for new image uploads, resizes the images, and then stores them back in the storage system. When an image is uploaded, the cloud provider’s platform automatically triggers the function to execute, scales it based on the workload, and shuts it down once the task is completed. This allows developers to focus on writing the image resizing logic without worrying about server provisioning or maintenance.
- Exactly comparable to what we have accomplished thus far. However, it is possible to rebrand our works using this new terminology.
### Integrated space-air-ground networks

- This integration has the potential to create a hierarchical communication system, forming a constellation of Non-Terrestrial Networking (NTN) satellites, High Altitude Platform (HAP)s, and Terrestrial Networking (TN) domains. In this system, users and resources (such as computing nodes) are linked through HAPs (such as UAVs) at one level, while HAPs are connected through NTN satellites (such as Geostationary Satellites (GEO)) at another level.
- One crucial factor to consider is the efficient sharing of frequencies, which can be improved by designing this integration to be RIS-aided.
- Pragmatic (Massive)-MIMO and intra/inter-system interference mitigation techniques are also useful for such integration.
- All of these platforms, whether they are non-terrestrial, high-altitude, or terrestrial, have the capability to be equipped with computing resources designed for task offloading.
- The final destination: deep space networks or the interplanetary Internet?

## 6G for Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)

### Orchestrating big AI/ML models

- Deploying large-scale AI/ML models to enable complex, emerging services faces numerous challenges. These include the substantial volume of training data required, as well as the computation and transmission of large-scale model parameters. Moreover, due to the distributed nature of data and computing resources, deploying such implementations often necessitates collaboration among numerous network and computing resources for tasks like training, inference, and task accomplishment. For example, mobile AI-Generated Content (AIGC) is an emerging service used for various applications such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. These models typically contain billions of parameters, making their deployment on the edge challenging due to limited resource capacity. Furthermore, deploying these models in core clouds and managing the large-scale distributed data required for training introduces significant transmission latency. Another challenge lies in ensuring the adaptability of these models to dynamic environments, addressing issues of scalability and real-time responsiveness. Hence, there’s a need to explore novel network/computing designs to support the deployment of large AI/ML models. Integrating network, computing, and learning offers a promising solution to address these challenges.
- This involves orchestrating 6G resources for AI/ML techniques through:
1. choosing an appropriate AI/ML strategy (centralized, distributed, or federated learning),
1. allocating computing nodes and capacity to execute AI/ML tasks efficiently, and
1. determining network paths between consumers and data sources, as well as AI/ML tasks, to facilitate the exchange of necessary messages.
These three steps must be carried out while taking into account the state information of network/computing resources, as well as the state of AI/ML training/inference tasks, in order to ensure End-to-End (E2E) quality.

- In the case of Collaborative Learning (ColL), the impact of user/resource mobility or interference on resource-efficient collaborative learning can be investigated.
- Moreover, game-theoretic approaches can be designed incentivizing resource-limited nodes to participate in the collaborative learning process.
## Semantic Communications in 6G

Inspired by the classic information theory, the design of a communications system or architecture mainly involves three different levels of problems, namely, (i) transmission of symbols (the technical problem); (ii) semantic exchange of transmitted symbols (the semantic problem); (iii) effect of semantic information exchange (the effectiveness problem). In contrast to the Shannon paradigm whose underlying principle is to guarantee the correct reception of each single transmitted packet regardless of its meaning (i), semantic communication is concerned with the problem of how transmitted symbols convey a desired meaning to the destination, as well as how effectively the received meaning affects the action in a desired way (ii and iii). By communicating the meaning or semantics of the data, semantic communication holds the promise of utilizing resources significantly more efficiently. To build a pathway to semantic communications, the subsequent topics may be considered.

### E2E semantic communication system design

1. Efficient/scalable neural network architectures and training algorithms for semantic communications
### Networking aspects and protocols for goal-oriented semantic communications

### Freshness vs. value perception tradeoffs in semantic communications

### Precision (or other quality metrics) vs. cost tradeoffs in semantic communications

### Semantic communications for eXtended Reality (XR)/holographic communications

1. Considering XR/holographic traffic characteristics and connectivity requirements.
### Semantic communications to enable the Metaverse

1. Metaverse network architecture integrating human factors
### Social-aware networking algorithms, techniques and social-aware communication systems

- Leveraging social awareness can be instrumental in managing communication systems. By understanding the dynamics of social relationships, including close ties, shared interests, and community affiliations, it becomes possible to predict and influence user interactions. Researchers have successfully represented these interactions using graph models, identifying patterns of trust, community structures, influential users, and information flow. Moreover, the intertwining of social and spatial dimensions highlights the significance of physical proximity in fostering social connections, both online and offline. Therefore, integrating insights from online social networks and real-world interactions can significantly impact various aspects of network management, including traffic optimization and resource allocation.
### Cross-layer communications and network management for affective sensing

- Affective sensing, also known as emotion sensing, refers to the technology and methodologies used to detect, interpret, and analyze human emotions. This involves capturing data from various sources such as facial expressions, voice tone, body language, physiological signals (like heart rate or skin conductance), and even text analysis to infer emotional states.
- In communication systems and network management, affective sensing can have several implications. For example, affective sensing can also be used in network management to detect anomalies or issues in communication networks. For instance, sudden spikes in frustration levels during video calls could indicate network congestion or poor call quality, prompting network orchestrators to take corrective action.
## Experimentation in Large-Scale Testbeds

### Constructing a testbed for experimental investigation of research findings

- Validating research outcomes via theoretical analysis and computer simulations alone carries the risk of using models that fall short of capturing real-world circumstances, including protocol aspects and hardware impairments. These shortcomings in such evaluation methodologies may result in misleading conclusions about the real-world performance of new technology.
## Quantum-based Systems

### High-dimensional (?) Quantum Internet (QI)

### Designing QI architectures

### Resource allocation framework for QI.

1. Quantum routing (?)
1. Distributed quantum computation over quantum cloud
### Designing hybrid classical-quantum systems

### Network synchronization solutions

### Quantum AI/ML for QI

### Integrated NTN and TN to enable QI

- QI aims for reliable generation, transmission, and manipulation of quantum states for communication. Future QI is envisioned as an entangled network structure, relying on quantum entanglement and teleportation. Challenges remain in creating entanglement over long distances, with freespace quantum links and satellite-ground station links being explored. Satellites, particularly Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) constellations, are crucial for a global QI. A combination of quantum satellites and UAVs holds promise for advancing QI on a global scale.

### Quantum Internet of Space Things (IoST)

1. Satellite Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
1. Ad hoc quantum satellite network design
## Energy/Power Harvesting/Transfer in 6G

### Designing near-zero energy communication systems

- Imagine a world of ambient Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To maximize the throughput (amount of data sent) of these devices, the following challenges need to be addressed.
- Longer energy harvesting time allows the device to harvest more energy, enabling larger data packets to be transmitted. However, this translates to less time for actual transmission, potentially leading to delays and lower throughput. On the other hand, shorter energy harvesting time leaves more time for transmission. However, with limited energy harvested, the device might only be able to send smaller and limited number of data packets, ultimately reducing overall throughput. The key is to find the optimal waiting time that balances energy harvesting with data transmission, maximizing the amount of data sent by these ambient IoT devices.
- These ambient IoT devices can also be controlled in terms of their mobility and positioning. We can strategically instruct them to expend some energy on moving closer to the base station. This strategy aims to reduce the transmission energy required to send data, as shorter distances require less power. However, this introduces another trade-off: movement energy consumption vs. transmission energy consumption. The optimal approach involves finding the sweet spot that minimizes the total energy expenditure. This might involve calculating the combined energy costs of movement and transmission based on the device’s current location and the distance to the base station.

# Constraints

## System Parameters

### Network 

The network infrastructure may consist of the following domains, different administrative domains with conflicting interests on one hand and potential for cooperation on the other:

1. TNs: TNs encompass communication infrastructures on Earth’s surface, including:
1. Radio networks provided by Ground Base Station (GBS)s
1. Wired networks
1. Optical networks
These networks facilitate communication among users within terrestrial locations, covering various environments like urban areas, rural regions, and suburban areas.

1. HAPs: A HAP refers to a stationary or quasi-stationary platform that operates at altitudes higher than traditional terrestrial infrastructure but lower than satellites. These platforms are typically deployed in the Earth’s atmosphere, often at altitudes ranging from 17 to 22 kilometers (about 55,000 to 72,000 feet). HAPs come in diverse forms, such as tethered balloons, airships, or UAVs, and are outfitted with communication equipment. They serve as Arial Base Station (ABS), extending the coverage and capacity of radio networks, especially in remote or underserved regions. Functioning as relay stations, these ABSs can bridge communication gaps between GBSs.
1. NTNs: NTNs involve communication systems that operate beyond Earth’s surface, often in space. They typically include various types of satellites as key components of their infrastructure. These satellites can be categorized into different types based on their orbits and functions:
1. GEO: These satellites orbit the Earth at a fixed position relative to the planet’s surface. They remain in a fixed position above the equator, allowing them to provide continuous coverage to a specific geographic area.
1. LEO: LEO satellites orbit the Earth at lower altitudes compared to GEO satellites, typically at altitudes ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand kilometers. They move much faster than GEO satellites and complete orbits around the Earth in a relatively short period, typically within a couple of hours. LEO satellites offer lower latency compared to GEO satellites but require a larger number of satellites to achieve global coverage due to their lower altitude.
1. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): MEO satellites orbit the Earth at altitudes higher than LEO satellites but lower than GEO satellites. They typically orbit at altitudes ranging from around 8,000 to 20,000 kilometers.
1. Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO): HEO satellites follow highly elliptical orbits, spending the majority of their time at high altitudes over specific regions of the Earth.
NTN may leverage one or a combination of these satellite types to establish a global or regional communication network, depending on the requirements of the use case and the desired coverage area.

1. In addition, the following adjustments can be taken into consideration:
1. The network devices with non-physical interfaces (GBSs, HAPs, and satelites) have the capability to be outfitted with MIMO/Large-scale antennas. MIMO antennas allow base stations to simultaneously transmit and receive multiple data streams over the same frequency band, effectively multiplying the capacity and improving the efficiency of wireless communication systems. Large-scale antenna systems, also known as massive MIMO or large-scale MIMO, involve deploying a large number of antennas, often hundreds or even thousands, at the base station. Unlike traditional MIMO systems, where a small number of antennas are used, large-scale antenna systems exploit the high spatial degrees of freedom offered by massive antenna arrays. This allows for more efficient spatial processing techniques, such as precoding and beamforming, to be applied. Large-scale antenna systems are capable of serving multiple users simultaneously with high spectral efficiency and improved coverage, making them well-suited for dense urban environments and high-capacity scenarios.
1. These devices have the capability to integrate RISs and RHSs. These surfaces are adept at manipulating electromagnetic signals, either by reflecting or refracting them, through dynamic adjustments of their phase shifts. RHSs possess the ability to actively generate beams in specified directions using wave-based beamforming techniques. Meanwhile, RISs can passively shape wireless propagation environments into desired configurations, achieving this in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner.
1. In the wireless domains of these networks, Coordinated Multiple Point (CoMP) can be used coordinating the transmission and reception of signals across multiple Base Station (BS)s. By synchronizing the operation of adjacent or overlapping cells and leveraging the spatial diversity provided by multiple transmission points, CoMP enables seamless interference mitigation among neighboring base stations. CoMP techniques can be applied in various scenarios, including coordinated scheduling, joint transmission and reception, and coordinated beamforming, depending on the specific requirements and network conditions. CoMP is particularly beneficial in dense urban environments, where interference and signal degradation are common due to the presence of multiple cells and high user density.

This splitting of data rates enables the system to allocate resources optimally, maximizing the overall throughput and spectral efficiency. RSMA is particularly advantageous in scenarios with heterogeneous user requirements or varying channel conditions, as it allows for flexible resource allocation tailored to each user’s needs.
